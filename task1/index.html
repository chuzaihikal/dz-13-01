        <h4>Reviews</h4>
        <p>★★★★☆</p>
        <p>This book is @#$%ed-up, sick, and creepy...I loved it. I love McEwan's style. He doesn't clutter his writing with unnecessary words, yet he says so much. His writing is sharp and clean. </p>
        <p>★★☆☆☆</p>
        <p>I prefer my books to have more plot and way less incest.</p>
        <p>★★★★★</p>
        <p>This is about what happens when children are isolated without authority. I find stories about isolation fascinating and sad. The theme of incest is strong here-but in no way is entirely what this is about.</p>
